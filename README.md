Lemonade is a marketplace on Slack that allows users to list, sell and buy items within a workspace. 

Created by Paul Jeon and Sky Park, Lemonade is developed using Google's Firebase. 

Users can upload an item's name, picture, and price, and Lemonade will list them on it's application page for anyone to view.

Any user in the workspace may request to buy your item, or ask for more pictures. Once marked as sold, the item will 
no longer appear in the list, but will always be available in your history.
